Hi, welcome to my first project. It is a web page developed in the front end course by Alura.
Below, there is images os the two pages made thinking in responsivity.

There is a main content, a header with link for navigation and a footer.
It was made really simple way, but i'm pretending to improve it in the future, to add more functionalities and increase the design.
